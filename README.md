# My Developer Portfolio ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal portfolio built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project showcases my skills as a Frontend Developer and serves as a hub for my projects, experiments, and growth as a developer.

## ðŸ”¨ Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) â€“ React framework for production-ready apps
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) â€“ type safety & scalable code
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) â€“ utility-first styling
- [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/) â€“ modern SVG icons
- [next-cloudinary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-cloudinary) â€“ image optimization
- [react-type-animation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-type-animation) â€“ typewriter text animation

## ðŸ“¸ Visuals
- Images were generated using [Leonardo AI](https://app.leonardo.ai/ai-generations).

## ðŸ“¬ Features
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Smooth animations
- Contact form powered by [Resend](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nextjs) for sending emails
- Optimized images using Cloudinary

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Improvement
This portfolio started as a **JavaScript project**, but I later **rewrote it in TypeScript** to improve:
- âœ… Type safety  
- âœ… Scalability  
- âœ… Maintainability  

It reflects my journey as a developer: not just building things that *work*, but refactoring and leveling them up with industry best practices.
