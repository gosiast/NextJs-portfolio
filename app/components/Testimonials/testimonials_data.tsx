    testimonial:
      "I had the pleasure of working with Gosia during my time as Co-Founder and CTO at Decubate, where she was an exceptional member of our frontend development team. What impressed me most was her remarkable growth trajectory and ownership mindset. She joined us as a junior developer with no Web3 experience, yet quickly evolved into a trusted mid-level developer who could independently lead critical projects. Her work on the Compliance Hub was instrumental in helping Decubate become the first MiCAR-licensed launchpad in the EU. Beyond her technical contributions, Gosia demonstrated natural leadership by founding SkillCraft Sessions, peer-led workshops that enhanced knowledge sharing and team collaboration. I recommend her without hesitation.",

      "Working with Gosia has been an absolute pleasure. Even though we’re in different departments, we collaborate closely on our internal compliance and KYC system as well as our launchpad/platform website, and she consistently impresses. Gosia is fast, thorough, and highly skilled in frontend development, delivering solutions that are both functional and polished. She’s also proactive and community-minded. She even created a company channel to help the team develop soft skills, showing her dedication to growth beyond her role. Her clear communication, helpfulness, and collaborative spirit make her a joy to work with. Any team would be lucky to have someone as talented, dependable, and thoughtful as Gosia.",

      "I've had the absolute privilege of working with Gosia during my time at 8BillionMinds. Gosia consistently goes above and beyond in her work, always seeking clarity where needed. She adds thoughtful UI tweaks that improve the overall UX — for example, ensuring users are scrolled to the field with validation errors, making the platform more intuitive. Gosia is open to feedback and actively seeks it, showing her dedication to continuous improvement. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any frontend development role.",
