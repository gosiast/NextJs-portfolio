    <p className="text-[#ADB7BE] text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-l mb-6">My name is MaÅ‚gorzata, but everyone calls me Gosia. I was born in Poland ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± but I've been living abroad over the past few years. 
        Currently, Spain ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ has become my home. Since 2019 I've been working as an English Teacher. In 2021 I've decided to shift my career and I fell in love with coding. 
        It's fascinating, challenging but incredibly rewarding. I would like to continue to grow as a Frontend Developer and learn more about the IT sector.</p>
