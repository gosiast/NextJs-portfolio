    <h2>About Me</h2>   
    <p>My name is Małgorzata, but everyone calls me Gosia. I was born in Poland 🇵🇱 but I've been living abroad over the past few years. 
        Currently, Spain 🇪🇸 has become my home. Since 2019 I've been working as an English Teacher. In 2021 I've decided to shift my career and I fell in love with coding. 
        It's fascinating, challenging but incredibly rewarding. I would like to continue to grow as a Frontend Developer and learn more about the IT sector.</p>
