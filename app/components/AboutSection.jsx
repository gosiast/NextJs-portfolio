            My name is Małgorzata, but everyone calls me Gosia. I'm Polish but
            I've been living abroad over the past few years. Currently, Spain
            has become my home. Since 2019 I've been working as an English
            Teacher. In 2021 I've decided to shift my career and I fell in love
            with coding. It's fascinating, challenging but incredibly rewarding.
            I would like to continue to grow as a Frontend Developer and learn
            more about the IT sector. I live by the “World Is Your Oyster”
            phrase and I strongly believe that we should take the opportunities
            that are waiting for us in the world.
