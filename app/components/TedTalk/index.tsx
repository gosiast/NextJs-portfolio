        personal development program about
        <span className="text-pink-400"> perseverance</span>. The message was
        simple:
        <strong className="text-white"> keep going</strong>. For me, that
        mindset isn’t just personal - it’s how I approach code. Debugging,
        learning new frameworks, it all requires resilience and curiosity.
        Sharing this talk was a way to show that persistence shapes not only my
        story, but also the way I grow as a developer.
